# GSERM 2023 Deep Learning: Fundamentals and Applications 🏔️

![Course Banner](banner.png)

Grüezi! 🖐️ Welcome to our GSERM course **Deep Learning: Fundamentals and Applications**, taught by **Prof. Dr. Damian Borth** and **Prof. Dr. Korbinian Riedhammer**. In this course, theoretical sessions and practical hands-on coding lab sessions alternate to provide a better learning experience. 

The guided coding labs will be taught by **Marco Schreyer**. The lab materials for Python programming, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning are available in and accessible through this GitHub repository.

Please use a laptop computer (not a tablet) for the lab courses to fully participate.

Viel Spass beim Programmieren! 🎉 (Happy Coding!)

## Course Code Lab Notebooks ![License: GPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv3-blue.svg)

Just like the timetable of the Swiss Federal Railways 🚞, the following table lists all lab sessions including the launchers of the corresponding notebooks 📚 . In order to start the notebooks in the respective cloud environment, click on the corresponding launchers. We aim to upload each lab notebook the day before the lab respectively.
